# Recipe Executor Code Files

**NOTE: THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ARE GENERATED. DO NOT EDIT THEM DIRECTLY.**

These files are generated by running the `make recipe-executor-create` or `make recipe-executor-edit` commands from the repository root. The code is generated from the "recipes" in [../recipes/recipe_executor]. The actual implementation will change more or less on each generation depending up on which model you use and if you choose the `create` or the `edit` option. The intent is to modify the component `spec` and `docs` files and then generate the code files vs editing the code files directly.

To generate a version of these files, run the script from the repository root:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository root
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Run the script to generate the recipe executor code files without any influence from existing code
make recipe-executor-create

# Or to generate the recipe executor code files with some influence from existing code
make recipe-executor-edit
```

These are shortcuts for:

- Create:
  - `recipe-tool --execute recipes/recipe_executor/create.json`
- Edit:
  - `recipe-tool --execute recipes/recipe_executor/edit.json`
