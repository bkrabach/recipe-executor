# Automated Test Suite Generation

Enhance the reliability of the module by creating tests:

- Examine the "prototype_calculator.py" implementation to identify testable functions.
- Generate a comprehensive test suite covering normal, edge, and error conditions.
- Save the tests to a file under the tests directory, for example "tests/test_prototype_calculator.py".
- Execute the generated tests and then analyze the results to suggest any further improvements for test coverage.
