# Enhanced Code Review

Perform a quality review on the current implementation:

- Load the contents of "prototype_calculator.py".
- Analyze the code for potential bugs, performance issues, security concerns, and adherence to coding standards.
- Generate a detailed review report describing any issues found along with suggestions for improvements.
- Save the review report to a file named "code_review_report.txt".
- Optionally, run the existing tests to validate the implementation.
