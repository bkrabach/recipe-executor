# Prototype Feature Implementation

Generate a simple prototype for a new feature as follows:

- Create a Python function that implements a basic calculator supporting addition and subtraction.
- Save the generated code to a file named "prototype_calculator.py" relative to the root directory.
- Execute the "prototype_calculator.py" file and verify that the function performs correctly.
