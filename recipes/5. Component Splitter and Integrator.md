# Component Splitter and Integrator

Decompose a complex project definition into individual components and integrate them:

- Process a composite project definition file to extract distinct component specifications.
- For each component, create a separate file with its content and include contextual details such as dependencies and interfaces.
- Generate integration tests for each component to verify their interactions.
- Compile a summary report that details the components extracted, their dependencies, and the results of the integration tests.
- Run a code review for each component to provide additional recommendations.
