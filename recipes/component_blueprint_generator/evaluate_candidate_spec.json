You'll analyze the candidate specification and identify any areas that need clarification or additional information.\n\nCandidate Specification:\n{{candidate_spec}}\n\nUse the following guides as your evaluation criteria:\n<SPEC_DOC_GUIDE>\n{{spec_doc_guide}}\n</SPEC_DOC_GUIDE>\n\n<IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY>\n{{implementation_philosophy}}\n</IMPLEMENTATION_PHILOSOPHY>\n\n<MODULAR_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY>\n{{modular_design_philosophy}}\n</MODULAR_DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY>\n\nPerform a systematic evaluation of the candidate specification with these steps:\n\n1. Identify the component name and type (if possible)\n2. Determine if a clear purpose statement exists\n3. Check if core requirements are well-defined and specific\n4. Assess if implementation considerations are provided\n5. Evaluate whether component dependencies are properly identified\n6. Check if error handling approaches are specified\n7. Look for any information about future considerations\n\nFor each aspect, provide:\n- A score from 1-5 (1=Missing/Insufficient, 5=Excellent)\n- Brief explanation of the score\n- Specific clarification questions if the score is 3 or lower\n\nFormat your response with these sections:\n1. Overall Assessment - Brief overview with readiness determination\n2. Scoring Summary - Table with scores for each aspect\n3. Detailed Analysis - Detailed assessment of each aspect with clarification questions\n4. Improvement Recommendations - List of questions to improve the specification\n\nBe constructive but thorough in your assessment.",
