# LLM Component Specification

## Purpose

The LLM component provides a unified interface for interacting with various large language model providers. It handles model initialization, request formatting, and response processing, enabling the Recipe Executor to generate content with different LLM providers through a consistent API.

## Core Requirements

1. Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
2. Provide model initialization based on a standardized model identifier format
3. Encapsulate LLM API details behind a unified interface
4. Use pydantic-ai for consistent handling and validation of LLM responses
5. Implement basic error handling and retry logic
6. Support structured output format for file generation

## Implementation Considerations

- Use a clear provider:model_name identifier format
- Direct usage of provider SDKs through pydantic-ai
- Minimal wrapper functions with clear responsibilities
- Consistent error handling with informative messages
- Logging of request details and timing information

## Component Dependencies

The LLM component depends on:

1. **Models** - Uses FileGenerationResult and FileSpec for structured output
2. **External Libraries** - Relies on pydantic-ai for model interactions

## Error Handling

- Provide clear error messages for unsupported providers
- Handle network and API errors gracefully
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Include timing information for performance monitoring

## Future Considerations

1. Support for streaming responses
2. Caching mechanism for response optimization
3. Additional LLM providers
4. Enhanced parameter control for model fine-tuning
