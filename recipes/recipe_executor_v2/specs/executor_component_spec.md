# Executor Component Specification

## Purpose

The Executor component is the central orchestration mechanism for the Recipe Executor system. It loads recipe definitions from various sources and executes their steps sequentially using the provided context.

## Core Requirements

1. Load and parse recipes from multiple input formats
2. Validate recipe structure and step definitions
3. Execute steps sequentially using registered step implementations
4. Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
5. Support minimal logging for execution status

## Implementation Considerations

- Parse recipes from file paths, JSON strings, or dictionaries
- Extract JSON from markdown fenced code blocks when present
- Use direct instantiation of step classes from the registry
- Handle errors at both recipe and step levels
- Maintain a simple, stateless design

## Component Dependencies

The Executor component depends on:

1. **Context** - Uses Context for data sharing between steps
2. **Step Registry** - Uses STEP_REGISTRY to look up step classes by type

## Error Handling

- Validate recipe format before execution begins
- Check that step types exist in the registry before instantiation
- Verify each step is properly structured before execution
- Provide specific error messages identifying problematic steps
- Include original exceptions for debugging

## Future Considerations

1. Parallel step execution
2. Conditional branching between steps
3. Step retry policies
4. Progress tracking and reporting
