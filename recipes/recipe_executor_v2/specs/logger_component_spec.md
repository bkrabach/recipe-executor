# Logger Component Specification

## Purpose

The Logger component provides a consistent logging interface for the Recipe Executor system. It initializes and configures logging, writes logs to appropriate files, and ensures that all components can log messages at different severity levels.

## Core Requirements

1. Initialize a logger that writes to both stdout and log files
2. Support different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
3. Create separate log files for each level
4. Clear existing logs on each run to prevent unbounded growth
5. Provide a consistent log format with timestamps and log levels
6. Create log directories if they don't exist

## Implementation Considerations

- Use Python's standard logging module directly
- Reset existing handlers to ensure consistent configuration
- Set up separate handlers for console and different log files
- Create the log directory if it doesn't exist
- Use mode="w" for file handlers to clear previous logs

## Component Dependencies

The Logger component has no external dependencies on other Recipe Executor components.

## Error Handling

- Catch and report directory creation failures
- Handle file access permission issues
- Provide clear error messages for logging setup failures

## Future Considerations

1. Log rotation for long-running processes
2. Remote logging options (e.g., syslog, ELK)
3. Customizable log formats
