# ReadFileStep Component Specification

## Purpose

The ReadFileStep component reads a file from the filesystem and stores its contents in the execution context. It serves as a foundational step for loading data into recipes, such as specifications, templates, and other input files.

## Core Requirements

1. Read a file from a specified path
2. Support template-based path resolution
3. Store file contents in the context under a specified key
4. Provide optional file handling for cases when files might not exist
5. Include appropriate logging and error messages
6. Follow minimal design with clear error handling

## Implementation Considerations

- Use template rendering to support dynamic paths
- Handle missing files explicitly with meaningful error messages
- Use consistent UTF-8 encoding for text files
- Implement optional flag to continue execution if files are missing
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on a single responsibility

## Component Dependencies

The ReadFileStep component depends on:

1. **Steps Base** - Extends BaseStep with a specific config type
2. **Context** - Stores file contents in the context
3. **Utils** - Uses render_template for path resolution

## Error Handling

- Raise FileNotFoundError with clear message when files don't exist
- Support optional flag to continue execution with empty content
- Log appropriate warnings and information during execution

## Future Considerations

1. Support for binary file reading
2. Custom encodings for different file types
3. Content transformation options (e.g., base64 encoding)
4. Directory reading and file globbing
