# Models Component Specification

## Purpose

The Models component defines the core data structures used throughout the Recipe Executor system. It provides Pydantic models for validating and structuring data, including recipe steps, file generation results, and step configurations.

## Core Requirements

1. Define consistent data structures for file generation results
2. Provide configuration models for various step types
3. Support recipe structure validation
4. Leverage Pydantic for schema validation and documentation
5. Include clear type hints and docstrings

## Implementation Considerations

- Use Pydantic models for all data structures
- Keep models focused and minimal
- Provide sensible defaults where appropriate
- Use descriptive field names and docstrings
- Focus on essential fields without over-engineering

## Component Dependencies

The Models component has no external dependencies on other Recipe Executor components.

## Future Considerations

1. Version fields for evolving schemas
2. Additional configuration models for new step types
3. Extended validation for complex fields
4. Support for serialization formats beyond JSON
