### Bootstrapping Steps

To illustrate the tool’s capabilities, the spec can include **bootstrapping steps** – an initial “recipe” that the tool will execute as it starts. These steps are defined in a simple structured format and are executed in order. In v0.1, we include one bootstrapping step utilizing the `WriteFile` action, to show the end-to-end flow from spec to action. The tool’s execution engine will parse these steps and carry them out immediately.

Below is a JSON-formatted list of bootstrapping steps that the tool will run on startup (embedded in the spec for easy parsing):

```json
[
  {
    "action": "WriteFile",
    "file_path": "hello_world.py",
    "content": "# This file was generated by Recipe Extractor Tool v0.1\nprint('Hello, World!')"
  }
]
```
