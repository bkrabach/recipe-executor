# Steps Base Component Specification

## Purpose

The Steps Base component defines the foundational abstract classes and interfaces for all step implementations in the Recipe Executor system. It provides a common structure for steps, ensuring consistent behavior and integration with the rest of the system.

## Core Requirements

- Define an abstract base class for all step implementations
- Provide a base configuration class for step configuration validation
- Establish a consistent interface for step execution
- Support proper type hinting using generics
- Include logging capabilities in all steps

## Implementation Considerations

- Use Python's abstract base classes for proper interface definition
- Leverage generic typing for configuration type safety
- Keep the base step functionality minimal but complete
- Use Pydantic for configuration validation
- Provide sensible defaults where appropriate

## Component Dependencies

The Steps Base component depends on:

- **Context** - Steps operate on a context object for data sharing
- **Models** - Uses Pydantic's BaseModel for configuration validation

## Error Handling

- Define clear error handling responsibilities for steps
- Propagate errors with appropriate context
- Use logger for tracking execution progress and errors

## Future Considerations

- Lifecycle hooks for pre/post execution
- Asynchronous execution support
- Step validation and dependency checking
- Composition of steps into more complex steps
