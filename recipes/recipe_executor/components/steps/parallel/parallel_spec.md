# ParallelStep Component Specification

## Purpose

The ParallelStep component enables the Recipe Executor to run multiple sub-recipes concurrently within a single step. It improves execution efficiency by parallelizing independent tasks while maintaining isolation between them.

## Core Requirements

- Accept a list of sub-step configurations (each of type `execute_recipe`)
- Clone the current execution context for each sub-step to ensure isolation
- Execute sub-steps concurrently with a configurable maximum concurrency limit
- Support optional delay between launching sub-steps
- Wait for all sub-steps to complete before proceeding
- Implement fail-fast behavior: if any sub-step fails, stop launching new ones and report the error

## Implementation Considerations

- Use a ThreadPoolExecutor to manage parallel execution of sub-steps
- Use Context.clone() to create independent context copies for each sub-step
- Implement configurable launch delay using time.sleep for staggered start times
- Monitor exceptions from each thread and implement fail-fast behavior
- Provide clear logging for sub-step lifecycle events and execution summary
- Manage resources efficiently to prevent memory or thread management issues

## Component Dependencies

### Internal Components

- **Steps Base** - (Required) Inherits from BaseStep for integration with the step execution framework
- **Context** - (Required) Uses Context.clone() to create isolated contexts for each parallel sub-step
- **Step Registry** - (Required) Uses registry to instantiate execute_recipe step for sub-steps
- **Executor** - (Required) Uses Executor to run each sub-recipe in separate threads
- **Utils** - (Optional) Uses template rendering for sub-step configurations

### External Libraries

- **ThreadPoolExecutor** - (Required) Uses concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel execution
- **time** - (Optional) Uses time.sleep for implementing launch delays between sub-steps

### Configuration Dependencies

None

## Output Files

- `steps/parallel.py` - Implementation of the ParallelStep class

## Logging

- Debug: Log sub-step start/completion events, thread allocation, and configuration details
- Info: Log start/completion with summary of parallel execution including numuber of steps and success/failure counts

## Error Handling

- Implement fail-fast behavior when any sub-step encounters an error
- Cancel pending sub-steps when an error occurs
- Include clear error context identifying which sub-step failed
- Ensure proper thread pool shutdown to prevent orphaned threads
- Propagate the original exception with contextual information about the failure

## Future Considerations

- Support for arbitrary step types beyond just execute_recipe
- Result aggregation from sub-steps back to parent context
- Dynamic concurrency control based on system load
- Timeout and isolation options for sub-steps
