# ReadFileStep Component Specification

## Purpose

The ReadFileStep component reads a file from the filesystem and stores its contents in the execution context. It serves as a foundational step for loading data into recipes, such as specifications, templates, and other input files.

## Core Requirements

- Read a file from a specified path
- Support template-based path resolution
- Store file contents in the context under a specified key
- Provide optional file handling for cases when files might not exist
- Include appropriate logging and error messages
- Follow minimal design with clear error handling

## Implementation Considerations

- Use template rendering to support dynamic paths
- Handle missing files explicitly with meaningful error messages
- Use consistent UTF-8 encoding for text files
- Implement optional flag to continue execution if files are missing
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on a single responsibility

## Logging

- Debug: Log the file path attempting to be read prior to reading (in case of failure)
- Info: Log the successful reading of the file (including path) and its storage in the context (including key)

## Component Dependencies

### Internal Components

- **Steps Base** - (Required) Extends BaseStep to implement the step interface
- **Context** - (Required) Stores file contents in the context under specified key
- **Utils** - (Required) Uses render_template for dynamic path resolution

### External Libraries

None

### Configuration Dependencies

None

## Error Handling

- Raise FileNotFoundError with clear message when files don't exist
- Support optional flag to continue execution with empty content
- Log appropriate warnings and information during execution

## Output Files

- `steps/read_file.py`

## Future Considerations

- Directory reading and file globbing
