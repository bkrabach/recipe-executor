# Step Registry Component Specification

## Purpose

The Step Registry component provides a central mechanism for registering and looking up step implementations by their type names. It enables the dynamic discovery of step classes during recipe execution.

## Core Requirements

- Provide a simple mapping between step type names and their implementation classes
- Support registration of step implementations from anywhere in the codebase
- Enable the executor to look up step classes by their type name
- Follow a minimal, dictionary-based approach with no unnecessary complexity

## Implementation Considerations

- Use a single, global dictionary to store all step registrations
- Allow steps to register themselves upon import
- Keep the registry structure simple and stateless
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or wrapper functions

## Component Dependencies

The Step Registry component has no external dependencies on other Recipe Executor components.

## Future Considerations

- Dynamic loading of external step implementations
- Step metadata and documentation
