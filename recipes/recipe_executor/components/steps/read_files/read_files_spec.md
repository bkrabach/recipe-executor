# ReadFilesStep Component Specification

## Purpose

The ReadFilesStep component reads one or more files from the filesystem and stores their contents in the execution context. It serves as a foundational step for loading data into recipes, such as specifications, templates, and other input files, with support for both single file and multi-file operations.

## Core Requirements

- Read a file or multiple files from specified path(s)
- Support both single string path, a comma-separate list of paths as a string, and list of paths strings as input
- If a string is provided, check for the presence of commas to determine if it should be treated as a list, then split accordingly
- Support template-based path resolution for all paths
- Store all file contents in the context under a single specified key
- Provide flexible content merging options for multi-file reads
- Support optional file handling for cases when files might not exist
- Include appropriate logging and error messages
- Follow minimal design with clear error handling

## Implementation Considerations

- Render template strings for path parameter before evaluting type of input
- Use template rendering to support dynamic paths for both single paths, comma-separated paths in in single string and lists of paths
- Handle missing files explicitly with meaningful error messages
- Use consistent UTF-8 encoding for text files
- Implement optional flag to continue execution if files are missing
- For multiple files, provide a way to merge contents (default: concatenate with newlines between filenames + content)
- Provide a clear content structure when reading multiple files (dictionary with filenames as keys)
- Keep the implementation simple and focused on a single responsibility
- For backwards compatibility, preserve behavior of single file reads

## Logging

- Debug: Log each file path attempting to be read prior to reading (in case of failure)
- Info: Log the successful reading of each file (including path) and the final storage in the context (including key)

## Component Dependencies

### Internal Components

- **Steps Base** - (Required) Extends BaseStep to implement the step interface
- **Context** - (Required) Stores file contents in the context under specified key
- **Utils** - (Required) Uses render_template for dynamic path resolution

### External Libraries

None

### Configuration Dependencies

None

## Error Handling

- Raise FileNotFoundError with clear message when required files don't exist
- Support optional flag to continue execution with empty content for missing files
- Handle different error cases for single file vs. multiple files
- Log appropriate warnings and information during execution
- When reading multiple files where some are optional, continue with the files that exist

## Output Files

- `steps/read_files.py`

## Future Considerations

- Directory reading and file globbing
- Advanced content merging options
- Additional metadata capture (file stats, timestamps)
- Content transformation options (pre-processing)

## Dependency Integration Considerations

None
