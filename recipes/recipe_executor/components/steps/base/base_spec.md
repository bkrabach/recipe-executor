# Steps Base Component Specification

## Purpose

The Steps Base component defines the foundational abstract classes and interfaces for all step implementations in the Recipe Executor system. It provides a common structure for steps, ensuring consistent behavior and integration with the rest of the system.

## Core Requirements

- Define an abstract base class for all step implementations
- Provide a base configuration class for step configuration validation
- Establish a consistent interface for step execution
- Support proper type hinting using generics
- Include logging capabilities in all steps

## Implementation Considerations

- Use Python's abstract base classes for proper interface definition
- Leverage generic typing for configuration type safety
- Keep the base step functionality minimal but complete
- Use Pydantic for configuration validation
- Provide sensible defaults where appropriate

## Logging

- Debug: Step component initialized, including configuration details
- Info: None

## Component Dependencies

### Internal Components

- **Context** - (Required) Steps operate on a context object for data sharing
- **Models** - (Required) Uses Pydantic-based models for configuration validation

### External Libraries

- **pydantic** - (Required) Uses Pydantic for configuration class definition and validation
- **typing** - (Required) Uses Python typing for type hints and generics

### Configuration Dependencies

None

## Error Handling

- Define clear error handling responsibilities for steps
- Propagate errors with appropriate context
- Use logger for tracking execution progress and errors

## Output Files

- `steps/base.py`

## Future Considerations

- Lifecycle hooks for pre/post execution
- Asynchronous execution support
- Step validation and dependency checking
- Composition of steps into more complex steps
