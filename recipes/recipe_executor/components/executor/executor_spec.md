# Executor Component Specification

## Purpose

The Executor component is the central orchestration mechanism for the Recipe Executor system. It loads recipe definitions from various sources and executes their steps sequentially using the provided context.

## Core Requirements

- Load and parse recipes from multiple input formats
- Validate recipe structure and step definitions
- Execute steps sequentially using registered step implementations
- Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Support minimal logging for execution status

## Implementation Considerations

- Parse recipes from file paths, JSON strings, or dictionaries
- Use direct instantiation of step classes from the registry
- Handle errors at both recipe and step levels
- Maintain a simple, stateless design

## Component Dependencies

### Internal Components

- **Context** - (Required) Uses Context for data sharing between steps during recipe execution
- **Step Registry** - (Required) Uses STEP_REGISTRY to look up and instantiate step classes by type

### External Libraries

None

### Configuration Dependencies

None

## Logging

- Debug: Log recipe start, file name, parsed payload, step execution details, and completion
- Info: None

## Error Handling

- Validate recipe format before execution begins
- Check that step types exist in the registry before instantiation
- Verify each step is properly structured before execution
- Provide specific error messages identifying problematic steps
- Include original exceptions for debugging

## Output Files

- `executor.py`

## Future Considerations

- Parallel step execution
- Conditional branching between steps
- Step retry policies
- Progress tracking and reporting
