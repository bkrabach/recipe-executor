# Executor Component Specification

## Purpose

The Executor component is the central orchestration mechanism for the Recipe Executor system. It loads recipe definitions from various sources and executes their steps sequentially using the provided context.

## Core Requirements

- Load and parse recipes from multiple input formats
- Validate recipe structure and step definitions
- Execute steps sequentially using registered step implementations
- Provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Support minimal logging for execution status

## Implementation Considerations

- Parse recipes from file paths, JSON strings, or dictionaries
- Extract JSON from markdown fenced code blocks when present
- Use direct instantiation of step classes from the registry
- Handle errors at both recipe and step levels
- Maintain a simple, stateless design

## Component Dependencies

The Executor component depends on:

- **Context** - Uses Context for data sharing between steps
- **Step Registry** - Uses STEP_REGISTRY to look up step classes by type

## Logging

- Debug: Log recipe loading, parsing, and step execution details
- Info: Log successful step executions and recipe completions

## Error Handling

- Validate recipe format before execution begins
- Check that step types exist in the registry before instantiation
- Verify each step is properly structured before execution
- Provide specific error messages identifying problematic steps
- Include original exceptions for debugging

## Future Considerations

- Parallel step execution
- Conditional branching between steps
- Step retry policies
- Progress tracking and reporting
