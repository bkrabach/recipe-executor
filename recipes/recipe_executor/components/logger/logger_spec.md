# Logger Component Specification

## Purpose

The Logger component provides a consistent logging interface for the Recipe Executor system. It initializes and configures logging, writes logs to appropriate files, and ensures that all components can log messages at different severity levels.

## Core Requirements

- Initialize a logger that writes to both stdout and log files
- Support different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
- Create separate log files for each level
- Clear existing logs on each run to prevent unbounded growth
- Provide a consistent log format with timestamps and log levels
- Create log directories if they don't exist

## Implementation Considerations

- Use Python's standard logging module directly
- Reset existing handlers to ensure consistent configuration
- Set up separate handlers for console and different log files
- Create the log directory if it doesn't exist
- Use mode="w" for file handlers to clear previous logs

## Component Dependencies

The Logger component has no external dependencies on other Recipe Executor components.

## Error Handling

- Catch and report directory creation failures
- Handle file access permission issues
- Provide clear error messages for logging setup failures

## Future Considerations

- Customizable log formats
