Create a workflow that helps transform a product idea into a comprehensive marketing package:

1. Begin by reading the product idea description from 'product_concept.txt'.
2. Generate 5 potential product names using an LLM.
3. For each name, check domain availability using a web API.
4. Create a visual brand identity by:
   - Generating a logo design specification
   - Creating a color palette recommendation
   - Suggesting typography options
5. Draft marketing copy for:
   - Website homepage (headline, subheadline, and 3 key benefits)
   - Email announcement (subject line and body)
   - Social media posts (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram formats)
6. Generate a product pricing strategy with 3 tier options.
7. Create a competitive analysis by:
   - Identifying top 5 competitors
   - Analyzing their strengths and weaknesses
   - Positioning our product against them
8. Draft a product launch plan with timeline and key milestones.
9. Compile everything into a unified marketing package document.
10. If at any point user input is required (like selecting a favorite product name), pause execution and wait for input.

The final package should be saved in multiple formats (PDF, PPT, and plain text) for different stakeholders.
