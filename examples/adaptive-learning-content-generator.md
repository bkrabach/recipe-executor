Create a system that generates personalized educational content based on student learning profiles:

1. Read student profile data from 'student_profiles.json' which contains:
   - Learning style preferences (visual, auditory, reading/writing, kinesthetic)
   - Current knowledge level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - Subject interests
   - Previous assessment results
   - Attention span metrics
2. For the topic "Introduction to Machine Learning":
   - Generate a learning path with appropriate difficulty progression
   - Create content modules adapted to each learning style
   - Develop assessment questions for each module with varying difficulty
3. For visual learners:
   - Generate infographic specifications
   - Create animated concept explanations
   - Design diagram-based exercises
4. For auditory learners:
   - Write podcast-style explanations
   - Create interactive dialogue examples
   - Develop spoken-word exercises
5. For reading/writing learners:
   - Generate detailed text explanations
   - Create vocabulary lists and definitions
   - Develop writing prompts and exercises
6. For kinesthetic learners:
   - Design interactive simulations
   - Create problem-based learning scenarios
   - Develop project-based assessments
7. Include spaced repetition schedules for each content type.
8. Generate adaptive assessment logic that adjusts difficulty based on performance.
9. Create progress tracking mechanisms and milestone celebrations.
10. Package everything into a structured course folder with clear organization.

The system should regenerate content that doesn't meet readability or engagement thresholds.
