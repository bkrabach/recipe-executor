I need a tool that analyzes multiple PDF research papers on renewable energy from the 'research_papers' directory, extracts key information, and generates a comprehensive summary report with the following:

1. Read all PDF files in the 'research_papers' directory and convert them to text.
2. For each paper, extract: title, authors, publication date, key findings, methodology, and limitations.
3. Use an LLM to generate a detailed summary of each paper with a focus on practical applications.
4. Identify common themes and contradictions across papers.
5. Create visualizations showing:
   - Publication timeline
   - Frequency of key terms across papers
   - Network graph of author collaborations
6. Generate a final report with sections for: executive summary, paper summaries, cross-paper analysis, visualizations, and recommendations for future research.
7. Include citations in proper academic format.
8. Save the report as a markdown file and also create a PDF version.
9. If any paper cannot be processed, log the error and continue with the others.

The final report should be targeted at energy policy makers with limited technical background.
