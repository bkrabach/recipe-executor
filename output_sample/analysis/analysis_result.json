  "reasoning": "The Weather Service API project encompasses multiple distinct responsibilities that would benefit from a modular approach. The system needs to handle external API integrations, data processing, caching, authentication, rate limiting, and API serving - all of which represent separate concerns. Following our modular design philosophy, these should be split into self-contained components with clear interfaces between them. This approach will improve maintainability, allow for parallel development, enable independent scaling of components based on resource needs, and facilitate easier testing and updating of individual parts without affecting the whole system.",
