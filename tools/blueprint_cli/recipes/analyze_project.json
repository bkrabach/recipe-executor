It has a single, well-defined responsibility (follows Single Responsibility Principle)\n2. It has a clear and coherent API\n3. It can be developed and tested independently\n4. It has a reasonable number of dependencies (typically 0-5 external dependencies)\n5. It can be implemented by a single developer in a reasonable timeframe (1-2 weeks)\n\nIf the project needs to be split, briefly outline what the major components should be, with a 1-2 sentence description for each.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProvide your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"needs_splitting\": true/false,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Explanation of your decision\",\n  \"recommended_components\": [\n    {\n      \"component_id\": \"component_identifier\",\n      \"component_name\": \"Human Readable Component Name\",\n      \"description\": \"Brief description of this component\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf the project doesn't need splitting, the `recommended_components` array should be empty.\n\nComponent IDs should be in snake_case, lowercase, and descriptive of the component's purpose.\n\nFilename should be `project_analysis_result.json` with no directories or paths.",
