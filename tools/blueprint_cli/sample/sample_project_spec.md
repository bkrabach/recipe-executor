# Weather Service API

## Overview

This project is a RESTful API service that provides weather information for specified locations. It will integrate with external weather data providers, process and cache the data, and serve it through a clean, well-documented API.

## Requirements

- Fetch current weather conditions for a specified location
- Provide 5-day weather forecasts for specified locations
- Support location specification by city name, coordinates, or zip code
- Cache weather data to reduce calls to external services
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Provide detailed error handling and logging
- Support multiple external weather data providers for redundancy
- Include authentication for API access

## Technical Constraints

- Use FastAPI for the API framework
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching
- Docker for containerization
- Support horizontal scaling for high availability
- Implement async I/O for better performance

## Implementation Guidelines

The service should follow a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns. It should be designed to allow easy addition of new weather data providers, and easy modification of the processing pipeline. Error handling should be comprehensive, with appropriate error messages for various failure modes.

Cache invalidation should be time-based, with different TTLs for different types of data. Authentication should use JWT tokens. The API should include appropriate rate limiting to prevent abuse, while still allowing legitimate high-volume users.
